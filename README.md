A fun discord bot for my friends

Environmnts:

There is one environment currently, a DEV environment where the dev branch lives.
Master gets deployed to dockerhub, where it gets pulled down onto the production server.
Master gets released periodically, currently there is no specific release schedule, I just cut releases whenever I feel there is a significant enough change.


Setting up local environment:
You need to create your own discord bot in the dev portal, and add the bot to that server.
